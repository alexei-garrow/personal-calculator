//create a variable entries (they've used an array) I'm guessing this is where we type things to be
//calculated.

//There is a variable for the total, they've used a 0;

//A temporary variable string? $ ? is a concatonation, insert a piece of script.
//This has has a onclick, text insert function. Creates intteractivity

//This next bit grabs a number and adds it to the temp, checks via an if and a === for '.' does this mean decimal number?
//It then concatonates. Maybe if decimal do this, otherwise reset? So maybe
//It's like if it's a number not sure on the "." else clear / reset
//We are making buttons on the calculator.
//So the next one is the CE button //clear last entry. Take you back one.

//eval() method? Can add a string together?!?

//They then change the multiply symbol to work with the eval method?>

//The same with divide

//Create the equals '=' button? Seems like a for loop something like this, taken from
//stack overflow:
// var operators = {
//   '+': function(x, y) { return x + y; },
//   '-': function(x, y) { return x - y; },
//   '*': function(x, y) { return x * y; },
//   '/': function(x, y) { return x / y; }
//};
//
//
//Under this swap the - symbol so it handles correctly?

//answer entry, a new blank array and a temp

//else push number to temp and val (with a new empty temp string)

//Math.abs should be super useful

//This outline is like one giant function? We could make smaller ones..
